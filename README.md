# CHAOS: Compressed Hierarchical Addressable Object Structure

**CHAOS** is a next-generation binary serialization format built for **speed, compactness, and instant query access** on massive read-only datasets.
It bridges the gap between JSON’s flexibility and FlatBuffers’ performance — delivering **microsecond-level queries** without sacrificing schema freedom or self-description.

---

## Why CHAOS?

Unlike traditional binary formats that require predefined schemas or full data deserialization, CHAOS offers:

* **Self-Describing Format:** No schema files needed — CHAOS encodes metadata and dictionaries inline.
* **JSON-Compatible Hierarchy:** Mirrors JSON structure for easy integration with existing pipelines.
* **Instant Random Queries:** Decode only what you ask for — access deep fields in microseconds without loading full data.
* **Memory-Mapped Access:** Uses `mmap` for zero-copy reads on huge files (gigabyte-scale data with minimal RAM).
* **Compact Storage:** Typically 40–70% of original JSON size.
* **Parallel Engine:** Fully multithreaded encoding and decoding paths for maximum throughput.

---

## Architecture Overview

A `.chaos` file consists of:

1. **Header Size** – variable-encoded integer.
2. **Header Block** – includes:

   * Global dictionary (keys, type descriptors)
   * Entity count
   * Offset table width
   * Offset table (random access lookup table)
3. **Data Region** – encoded Objects, Lists, and Values in compact binary layout.
   References use table IDs; primitives are encoded directly (int, float, bool, string).

On decode, CHAOS memory-maps the file, reads only the header once, and lazily resolves offsets on demand.
That makes second-query lookups nearly instantaneous.

## Example Usage

### 1. Encode JSON → CHAOS

```bash
./chaos_tool encode parallel data.json data.chaos
```

### 2. Decode CHAOS → JSON

```bash
./chaos_tool decode parallel data.chaos
```

### 3. Query Specific Fields (Single)

```bash
./chaos_tool decode query data.chaos 45 location lat
```

### 4. Query Multiple Fields 

```bash
./chaos_tool decode query telemetry.chaos 45 location lat '|' 53 sensors temperature '|' 98 timestamp '|' 32 status
```

Output:

```
Query 1 (/45/location/lat): 36.692696 (695 ms)
Query 2 (/53/sensors/temperature): 5.14 (7 µs)
Query 3 (/98/timestamp): "2025-10-11T10:42:50.970520" (9 µs)
Query 4 (/32/status): "OK" (5 µs)
```

## Design Philosophy

CHAOS was created to power **AI pipelines, telemetry systems, and edge analytics** — where most operations require only selective reads from immutable data.
Instead of decoding terabytes just to fetch one field, CHAOS gives **direct indexed access** to the required nodes.

It’s ideal for:

* AI preprocessing and feature extraction pipelines
* Sensor/IoT telemetry stores
* Log archives and ML dataset caches
* Any system where **read-only structured data** must be queried in real time

## Build Instructions

### Prerequisites

* C++17 or newer (GCC ≥ 9, Clang ≥ 11)
* LZ4 development library (`liblz4-dev` on Linux, `brew install lz4` on macOS)

### Build (Manual)

```bash
g++ -std=c++17 -O3 -I. \
    encoder.cpp encoder_parallel.cpp decoder.cpp decoder_parallel.cpp datastruct.cpp main.cpp \
    -llz4 -o chaos_tool_v1
```

**Current Version:** v1.0 — Core encoder/decoder/query engine (C++)

| CHAOS encode         | 432451 ms (parallel) |
| JSON decode          | 426117 ms            |
| CHAOS decode         | 243311 ms            |
| JSON query           | 54561 ms             |
| CHAOS query (cold)   | 2388 ms              |
| CHAOS query (cached) | 5–9 µs               |

## 🔧 Makefile & Python Binding

The repository now includes a **Makefile** to simplify builds and a **Python binding** (`pychaos`) for high-level selective queries.

### Build everything

```bash
make
```

### Build Python module only

```bash
make pychaos
```

This compiles `pychaos_query.cpp` into a native extension (`pychaos.so`), allowing direct use from Python.

### Example Python usage

```python
import pychaos

queries = [
    ["1", "timestamp"],
    ["2", "device_id"]
]

result, ms = pychaos.query("CHAOS/telemetry.chaos", queries)
print(f"Query done in {ms} ms, result size = {len(result)} bytes")
```

### Build standalone CLI binary

```bash
make cmdline
./cmdline
```

### Clean everything

```bash
make clean
```
